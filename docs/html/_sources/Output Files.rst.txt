The ED GROUND OBS executable is the elementary ED calculation with only static observable evaluations. The
main results include the eigen energies, printed by default into ‘eigen energies.in‘ file as a matrix (rows for different
configuration sectors and columns for different excited state), and the computed expectation values of observables,
printed by default into ‘ground observables.in‘ (for ground-state calculation) or ‘ensemble observables.in‘ (for
ensemble calculation).
